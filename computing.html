  <h1><b>My A Level Computer Science Coursework!</b></h1>
  <h2>For my coursework I have decided to create a program that will allow users to plot and solve different graph functions 
    with a visual aid. I came across this idea of a graphing calculator whilst studying for my AS-Level maths and solving 
    complex equations such as polynomials and equations of conics. I found it hard to visualise the graphs and transformations 
    in my head and often had to spend time inaccurately sketching the graph out manually, and thus I feel that a graphing calculator
    with a visual aid would be of much use to students who are studying maths. It will also be of use to teachers, as they could use
    this tool in their lessons and thus saving time in lessons, allowing more content to be taught to the students.</h2>

      <h4><b>What are the objectives of my coursework?</b></h4>
      <p></p>
      <p> 1.	My solution must have a user-friendly GUI of which includes a clear x and y axis and must be able to plot any 
        coordinate point. It must be designed in a way that users with little knowledge of math and IT should still be able 
        to use the tool with ease.</p>
      <p> 2.	My solution must be able to handle and plot functions involving trigonometry, the modulus function, exponents 
        and the natural log. It should also be able to handle input functions with multiple complex mathematical procedures 
        within </p>
      <p> 3.	The solution must be able to plot multiple functions on the same set of axis, of which are distinguished with 
        labels and different colours for the lines. </p>
      <p> 4.	My solution must include labels of key coordinate points of any function plotted. For example, any x or y intercepts
        must be labelled, along with any stationary points. Also, if there are multiple graphs plotted on the same axis, then any 
        points of intersection of the graphs must be labelled too.</p>
      <p> 5.	As differentiation is an important concept to understand for A-Level maths, I would like to implement this into my 
        solution. There will be a feature which will be able to differentiate any polynomial, trigonometric function, exponential 
        or natural log. Again, this feature must be able to be done on any equation which may also involve multiple complex math 
        functions together.</p>
      <p> 6.	My solution must be able to calculate whether a function has any asymptotes, and if it does then these asymptotes
        must be plotted on the same set of axis represented with a dotted line. </p>

      <h3><b>What are the complex principles? </b></h3>
      <h4><p> Inputs of Functions Standard Layout</p></h4>
      <p>For complex polynomials, such as quadratics or cubics, there is a norm in terms of how the function is expressed. 
        For example, quadratics use the form〖ax〗^2+bx+c and cubics use the form〖〖ax〗^3+bx〗^2+cx+d. I will have to find
        a way in which the input is converted into this form, as sometimes a function may not be entered in order of powers.
        I may also have to implement an on-screen button of which allows the user to enter an index, because there is not a 
        direct way of using the keyboard to input indices. This will be the case for other mathematical functions such as square 
        roots and cube roots.</p>
      <h4><p>How to draw the actual curve?</p></h4>
      <p>One big difficulty that I will have to overcome is the ability to make the lines joining the coordinates together to 
        look like a curve. I will have to produce a piece of code which will plot points for successive values of x, with as 
        little difference as possible between the x values. I will have to use an iterative method to do this (most probably 
        a for loop) and will plot the points and then use a drawing function to draw a line between the points. <p>
